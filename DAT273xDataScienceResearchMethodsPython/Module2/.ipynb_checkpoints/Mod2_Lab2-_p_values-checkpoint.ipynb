    "The Null Hypothesis\n",
    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we briefly review what the null hypothesis is. Recall from the\n",
    "previous lab that the results that come from samples are only mere\n",
    "estimates of the population. Because they are estimates, the statistics\n",
    "they produce will differ somewhat from their population counterparts.\n",
    "For example, the correlation between engagement in a sample may be *r* =\n",
    ".2 even when the correlation between those same variables in the\n",
    "population is something smaller, such as .10 or even 0. This can cause\n",
    "apparent relationships and effects to appear in *samples* when none in\n",
    "fact exists in the population. This idea--that the effect/association is\n",
    "*zero* in the population--is called the null hypothesis. By implication,\n",
    "any effect/association seen in the *sample* must be entirely due to the\n",
    "random chance of \"sampling error.\" In other words, the null hypothesis\n",
    "claims that the sample result is a random fluke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore an application of this. Imagine we want to compare males\n",
    "and females in terms of their interest in a given product. Imagine, for\n",
    "a moment, that *the two groups have identical interest* (in the\n",
    "population)...that is, there is no difference between the groups.\n",
    "Nevertheless, if we take a sample of males and a sample of females, the\n",
    "error in our estimations will cause a difference to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that *both* males and females had an interest level averaging at\n",
    "5, with a standard deviation of 3."

    "\n",
    "To test the null hypothesis, we simply ask: *if the null hypothesis were\n",
    "true, what percentage of the time would I get this result this large?*\n",
    "The answer to that question is called a *p*-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of confusion about *p*-values, so let's review:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *p*-values represent how often you could get a result as big as you\n",
    "    did *if the null were true*\n",
    "-   *p*-values therefore represent how easy/hard it would be to get a\n",
    "    result by chance\n",
    "-   *p*-values do **not** tell you the probability that the result is\n",
    "    due to chance; only the probability of seeing *your result* if the\n",
    "    null were true\n",
    "-   If the *p*-value for a result is small, it would be rare to get that\n",
    "    result by chance (i.e., if the null were true)\n",
    "-   If the *p*-value for a result is large, it would be common to get\n",
    "    that result by chance (i.e., if the null were true)\n",
    "-   Conclusion: the *p*-value is a measure of \"incompatibility\" between\n",
    "    your result and the null. If the *p*-value is small, one of the two\n",
    "    (the data, or the null) is likely wrong. We opt to trust our data\n",
    "    and reject the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear: the *p*-value is a backwards way of testing the null\n",
    "hypothesis. We would love to know the *probability* that the null\n",

    "chance--but we cannot know that. You will often hear the *p*-value\n",
    "described this way, but that is **very wrong**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to repeat, the *p-value states the probability of getting **your\n",

    "incompatibility between your data and the null. A small *p*-value\n",
