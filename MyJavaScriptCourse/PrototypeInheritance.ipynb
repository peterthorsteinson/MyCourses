    "# Prototype Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The **ES2015** (ES6) ```class``` keyword is just syntactic sugar. Inheritance still remains dynamically prototype-based below the surface (nothing really changed except for the nice new syntax)\n",
    "\n",
    "See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain\n",
    "\n",
    "* We often want to take an existing type of object and extend it to make a derived type object\n",
    "* An ```Animal``` type may be the parent type of the child ```Dog``` and ```Cat``` types\n",
    "* So a derived type of object is just a more specialized type of the general base type\n",
    "* Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its ```prototype```\n",
    "* The ```prototype``` has a ```prototype```, and so on until a null prototype is reached (prototype chain)\n",
    "* The final ```prototype``` is ```null``` and has no further prototypes (end of the chain)\n",
    "* Objects are simply dynamic sets of properties (a.k.a. \"own properties\")\n",
    "* If you access a property of an object that does not have that property, then the prototype is used\n",
    "* The ```property``` is either found along the chain or, if it is not found, then it is ```undefined```\n",
    "* ```__proto__``` is the historical getter/setter for an object's prototype\n",
    "* You can extend one instance object with another instance  object in this way\n",
    "* You can also extend an etire class of object (type) with another by extending the constructor function prorotype\n",
    "* You can also extend built-in objects (e.g. Array) using the prorotype mechanism (can be risky)"
