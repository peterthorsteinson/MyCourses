    "- **Data Source** First the data must be imported from some data source, such as a file, database, or web API, and that data is usually loaded into a data frame. \n",
    "- **Tidy** Tidying data means storing it in a consistent structure where each table column is a variable, and each row is an observation, and missing data and outliers may be handled in a useful way.\n",
    "- **Transform** Transforming data includes activities that focus on specific variables in the data, or create new convenience variables that are computed from existing variables, and calculate summary statistics. Together, tidying and transforming data is known as data wrangling.\n",
    "- **Visualize** Data visualisation provides insight into your data that can deepen understanding and guide further inquirey. Visualisation requires human or artificial intellegence to interpret the underlying meaning embedded in the data.\n",
    "- **Model** A data model is a mathematical or algorithmic reprsentation of data relationships that can verify a hypothesis about the data, or make new predictions from the data.\n",
