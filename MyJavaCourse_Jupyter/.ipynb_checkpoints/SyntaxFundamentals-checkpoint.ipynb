    "\n",
    "* Variable names are case-sensitive identifiers.\n",
    "* An identifier is an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits.\n",
    "* Variable names must begin with a letter, the dollar sign ```$```, or underscore ```_```.\n",
    "* Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscores.\n",
    "* Variable names, by convention, begin with a letter (not ```$``` or ```_```).\n",
    "* Human-defined variables, by convention, do not contain ```$``` (intended for auto-generated code).\n",
    "* Variable names, by convention, should not start with ```_```.\n",
    "* Variable names must not contain white space or punctuation.\n",
    "* Variable names must not be any keyword or reserved word.\n",
    "* Singleword variable names should be all lowercase letters.\n",
    "* Multiword variable names should start lowercase and capitalize first letter of subsequent words.\n",
    "* Constant variables should be all uppercase with words separated with underscores (camel case).\n",
    "* The underscore character, by convention, is never used elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kinds of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:\n",
    "* Fields (a.k.a instance variables or object data members) contain values that represent object state. Their values are specific to each object instance of the class. They are declared in a class without the static keyword. For example the following example defines a field named balance in a class named BankAccount. The value of the balance field in one instance of BankAccount is independent of the balance field in another instance of BankAccount.\n",
    "* Static fields (a.k.a  class variables or class data members) contain data that is associated with the class as a whole rather than specific instances of the class. A class variable is simply a field variable declared with the static keyword. The compiler then knows that there is only one copy of this variable associated with the class itself, regardless of whether the class has been instantiated or how many times the class may have been instantiated. The value of the interestRate static field is associated with the BankAccount class and is independent any instances of BankAccount that may exist.\n",
    "* The keyword final can be applied to a static field or an instance field to indicate that the value used to initialize it can never change. A field named accountNumber would be an example of something that can never change at runtime.\n",
    "* Local Variables are defined within a method to store temporary state that is limited to the scope and lifetime of the code in which it is defined and manipulated. Local variables are temorary and they are only visible to code within the scope of visibility in whoch they are defined. The example below does not define any local variables.\n",
    "* Parameters are variables that are declared as received values that are passed into a method (or constructors or exception handlers) when they are called (invoked). In the calling methods we refere to them as arguments, and on the receivibg end, in the method signature, we refeer to them as parameters. Note that parameters are temporary variables but they are not fields. The example below defines parameters in several methods and in the constructor."

    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Data Types (built-in)\n",
    "\n",
    "Java is statically typed, That means all variables must be declared before they can be refernced. This You declare a variable by specifying the data type and name of the variable variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int weight = 120; // declare a variable of type int with name weight\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The data type of the variable determines the values it can contain and the operations that can be performed on it. There are value types (built-in primitive types) and refernce types (defined as classes, interfaces, and arrays). There are both mutable (can be modified) and immutable data types (can not be modified).\n",
    "\n",
    "Java supports eight primitive data types specified as reserved keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "***```byte```*** Default value: 0. The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). The byte data type can be useful for saving memory in large arrays, where the memory savings actually matters. They can also be used in place of int where their limits help to clarify your code; the fact that a variable's range is limited can serve as a form of documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "***```short```*** Default value: 0. The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive). As with byte, the same guidelines apply: you can use a short to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "***```int```*** Default value: 0. By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -231 and a maximum value of 231-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232-1. Use the Integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer. See the section The Number Classes for more information. Static methods like compareUnsigned, divideUnsigned etc have been added to the Integer class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "***```long```*** Default value: 0L. The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -263 and a maximum value of 263-1. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned 64-bit long, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 264-1. Use this data type when you need a range of values wider than those provided by int. The Long class also contains methods like compareUnsigned, divideUnsigned etc to support arithmetic operations for unsigned long.\n",
    "\n",
    "***```float```*** Default value: 0.0f. The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification. As with the recommendations for byte and short, use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. This data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. For that, you will need to use the java.math.BigDecimal class instead. Numbers and Strings covers BigDecimal and other useful classes provided by the Java platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "***```double```*** Default value: 0.0d. The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification. For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice. As mentioned above, this data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "***```boolean```*** Default value: false. The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. This data type represents one bit of information, but its \"size\" isn't something that's precisely defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "***```char```*** Default value: ```'\\u0000'```. The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of ```'\\u0000'``` (or 0) and a maximum value of ```'\\uffff'``` (or 65,535 inclusive)."
